# Dashboard

This is the 4th project in Module 9 (Working with APIs) of Scrimba's [Frontend Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). This unit focused on handling __promise rejections__ from an API by building a dashboard that communicates with the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) for crypto currency data, the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) for background images and the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for weather information, as well as using the local comuter for __time__ and __location__ information.

The course uses the `fetch` API along with `.then` and `.catch` methods to write asynchronous JavaScript to get data from external APIs and handle any errors. I took a different approach and upgraded from `.then` and `.catch` to using `async` and `await` to write asynchronous functions. My version is responsive, as well. It additionally includes a `manifest.json` file so that it can be imported into Chrome as a Chrome extension.
