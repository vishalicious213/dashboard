# Dashboard

This is the 4th project in Module 9 (Working with APIs) of Scrimba's [Frontend Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). This unit focused on handling __promise rejections__ from an API by building a dashboard that communicates with the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) for crypto currency data, the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) for background images and the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for weather information, as well as using the local comuter for __time__ and __location__ information.
